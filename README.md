Created a board game called Lines of Action.

Lines of Action is a board game invented by Claude Soucie. It is played on a checkerboard with ordinary checkers pieces. The two players take turns, each moving a piece, and possibly capturing an opposing piece. The goal of the game is to get all of oneâ€™s pieces into one group of pieces that are connected. Two pieces are connected if they are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
